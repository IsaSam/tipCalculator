Submitted by: **Isaac Samuel**

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## Submission Checklist
* [X] Did you successfully push your code to github? Can you see the code on GitHub?
* [X] Did you add a README which includes a GIF walkthrough of the app's functionality?
* [X] Did you use our README template for your README?
* [X] Does your GIF render directly in your README? When using Imgur, you can right-click on the gif and choose "Copy Image Address" to get the correct address. Make sure the address has a .gif extension. If you end up with a url that has a .gifv extension, removing the v and changing this to .gif will ensure the gif renders on GitHub.
